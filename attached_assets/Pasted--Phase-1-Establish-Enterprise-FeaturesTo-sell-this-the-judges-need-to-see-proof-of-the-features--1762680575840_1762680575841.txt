🎯 Phase 1: Establish Enterprise FeaturesTo sell this, the judges need to see proof of the features banks actually pay for (Source 2.1, 2.2):Compliance: Immutable audit trail, automated reporting. (Already done with compliance_logger.py).Security: Encrypted communication for sensitive alerts. (Already done with security_utils.py).Explainability: Human-readable causes for bias. (Already done with explainability_module.py).Actionability: Clear indicators and thresholds for immediate human intervention.💻 Phase 2: Upgraded Streamlit UI Prompt (Enterprise Polish)We will use Streamlit but leverage its features for a cleaner, more professional look, directly addressing the structure of the FairLens dashboards."Build a two-page Streamlit application that showcases the 'Fairness Drift Alert' system using a clean, enterprise-grade design that mirrors the structure of a professional monitoring platform. The Flask API must be running on http://localhost:5000.Goal: Create a visually persuasive prototype that focuses on data clarity and actionability for a bank auditor/risk manager.Setup: Create dashboard.py (Main Page) and pages/2_Compliance_and_Audit.py (Audit Log Page). Install streamlit, requests, and plotly (for better charts).FILE 1: dashboard.py (Monitoring)Layout: Use st.set_page_config(layout="wide") for maximum space.Header: Set the title to 'Live Model Monitoring | Loan Approval v1.0'.Demo Controls: Place a prominent st.button("Run Drift Scenario Check") at the top. This button calls the /api/monitor_fairness endpoint and updates the page data.Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Use st.columns(3) to display three main metrics in boxes, similar to the FairLens images:Current DIR: Show the numeric value. Use an icon and color (Red/Green) based on the $0.80$ threshold.Drift Status: Show 'CRITICAL' or 'STABLE'.Active Alerts: Show the count of recent alerts from the audit log tail.Fairness Trend Chart:Simulate historical DIR values (e.g., last 5 checks) in the Streamlit session state.Use plotly.graph_objects to create a line chart displaying the DIR trend. Add a clear, horizontal red line at $0.80$ (The Legal Threshold).Actionable Alert Box:If an alert is active, use st.expander or st.error to display a large, clear warning box titled '⚠️ CRITICAL: Bias Detected - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED'.Inside, display the full Human-Readable Explanation from the API.FILE 2: pages/2_Compliance_and_Audit.py (Audit Log)Title: Set the title to 'Compliance & Audit Log'.API Call: Call the /api/audit_history endpoint.Compliance Audit Log: Display the full log history using st.dataframe(..., use_container_width=True). This shows the auditor the immutable record of all checks.Security Proof: Add a small section to display the Encrypted Alert Token from the last API call, with a short explanation: 'Encrypted Alert Token (Fernet-secured for immutable storage)'.Export Placeholder: Add two simple buttons: st.button("Download PDF Compliance Report") and st.button("Export CSV Data"). These are placeholders, but they demonstrate a key enterprise feature (reporting).FINISH UPGRADED STREAMLIT PROJECT"
